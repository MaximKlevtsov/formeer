# Formeer

## Why
As someone who often tries to build complicated forms with [react-final-form]([https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form) and [formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik), I often find myself creating complicated wrappers around pre-existing non-standart (aka non-`<input />`) components which re-render too often. Also I'm hooked on React hooks (pun intended), which plays for me pretty badly optimization-wize with preveously mentioned libs. That's why one night I decided to desing and implement my own form library targeted specifically for usage with React's hooks.

# Install
```
$ yarn add formeer
```
